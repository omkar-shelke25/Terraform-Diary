# Steps to Log in to AWS via AWS CLI

## 1. **Install AWS CLI**
If you haven't installed the AWS CLI, you can download and install it using the instructions from the official AWS documentation:
- [AWS CLI Installation Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html)

## 2. **Configure AWS CLI**
After installing the AWS CLI, you need to configure it by providing your access credentials.

Run the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
aws configure
```

You will be prompted to enter the following information:

- **AWS Access Key ID**: You can retrieve this from your AWS Management Console.
- **AWS Secret Access Key**: Provided when creating the access key.
- **Default region name**: (Optional) The AWS region you'd like to use, such as `us-west-2` or `us-east-1`.
- **Default output format**: (Optional) Choose a format for output like `json`, `text`, or `table`.

## Example:
```bash
aws configure
AWS Access Key ID [None]: AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE
AWS Secret Access Key [None]: wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY
Default region name [None]: us-west-2
Default output format [None]: json
```
## 3. **Verify Configuration**
To ensure the configuration is correct, you can run a simple command like listing your S3 buckets:

```bash
aws s3 ls
```

If you have access, it will list your S3 buckets; otherwise, you'll see an error if the credentials are incorrect or permissions are insufficient.

## Additional Notes:
- The credentials you use with `aws configure` are stored in the `~/.aws/credentials` file for future use.
- You can update your configuration anytime by running `aws configure` again or manually editing the credentials file.
  
This will authenticate you to AWS using the CLI, allowing you to make API requests and manage your resources programmatically.


## Creating an Access Key for an IAM User

## Command to Create an Access Key:
To create an access key (access key ID and secret access key) for a specific IAM user, use the following command:

```bash
aws iam create-access-key \
    --user-name Bob
```

This example creates an access key for the IAM user named **Bob**.

## Output Example:
Upon successful execution, the output includes details about the newly created access key, as shown below:

```json
{
    "AccessKey": {
        "UserName": "Bob",
        "Status": "Active",
        "CreateDate": "2015-03-09T18:39:23.411Z",
        "SecretAccessKey": "wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYzEXAMPLEKEY",
        "AccessKeyId": "AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE"
    }
}
```

## Important Security Note:
- The **Secret Access Key** is available **only at the time of creation**.
- You must **store the secret access key in a secure location**. If it is lost, it cannot be recovered, and you will need to create a new access key.
- If the IAM user "Bob" does not exist and you run the `aws iam create-access-key --user-name Bob` command, AWS will return an error. The error will indicate that the specified user does not exist. Here's an example of what the error might look like:

```bash
An error occurred (NoSuchEntity) when calling the CreateAccessKey operation: The user with name Bob cannot be found.
```
- To avoid this error, you must first ensure that the IAM user "Bob" exists. You can do this by listing the users or creating the user if they don't already exist.

### Command to list IAM users:
```bash
aws iam list-users
```

### Command to create an IAM user:
If "Bob" does not exist, you can create the user with this command:
```bash
aws iam create-user --user-name Bob
```
After the user is created, you can then proceed with creating the access key.

### `aws iam list-access-keys` Command

- **Description**: Lists access keys for an IAM user.
- **Syntax**: 
  ```bash
  aws iam list-access-keys [--user-name <username>]
  ```
  - **`--user-name <username>`**: (Optional) Specify the IAM user; if omitted, lists access keys for the current IAM user.

- **Example Commands**:
  - List access keys for the current IAM user:
    ```bash
    aws iam list-access-keys
    ```
  - List access keys for a specific IAM user:
    ```bash
    aws iam list-access-keys --user-name Bob
    ```

- **Example Output**:
  ```json
  {
      "AccessKeyMetadata": [
          {
              "UserName": "Bob",
              "AccessKeyId": "AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE",
              "Status": "Active",
              "CreateDate": "2015-03-09T18:39:23.411Z"
          },
          {
              "UserName": "Bob",
              "AccessKeyId": "AKIAIOSFODNN7ANOTHER",
              "Status": "Inactive",
              "CreateDate": "2016-05-15T10:12:34.567Z"
          }
      ]
  }
  ```
  ![list](image-1.png)

- **Output Fields**:
  - **`UserName`**: IAM userâ€™s name.
  - **`AccessKeyId`**: Unique identifier of the access key.
  - **`Status`**: Key status (`Active` or `Inactive`).
  - **`CreateDate`**: Date and time when the key was created.

- **Permissions Required**: `iam:ListAccessKeys` action must be allowed in the IAM policy.

- **Common Error**: `AccessDenied` if permissions are insufficient.

- **Security Note**: Handle access keys securely and follow best practices.
