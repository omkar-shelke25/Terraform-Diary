# Explanation of the Behavior:

1. **Taint on Resource Failure**:
    - When the `terraform apply` command fails during the first execution due to a failed provisioner (like the `file` provisioner), Terraform marks the resource as **tainted**.
    - A **tainted resource** means that Terraform will destroy and recreate it during the next `terraform apply`.
2. **Recreation of Resources**:
    - On the second `terraform apply`, Terraform will:
        - Destroy the tainted EC2 instance.
        - Recreate the EC2 instance.
        - Attempt to run all provisioners (including the `file` provisioner) on the new instance.
3. **File Provisioner Behavior**:
    - If the issue (e.g., permissions) that caused the failure isn't resolved, the provisioner will likely fail again during the second execution.
    - If the issue is resolved, Terraform will successfully execute the `file` provisioner, copying the directory to the newly created instance.

## Why the Directory Might Not Be Copied:

If after the second `terraform apply`, the directory is not copied into the EC2 instance, it could be due to:

1. **Provisioner Execution Rules**:
    - Provisioners like `file` only run during the **creation** of a resource, not during updates. If Terraform does not detect a need to recreate the instance, the provisioner will not execute.
2. **Resource Dependencies**:
    - If the EC2 instance was recreated but the provisioner was skipped, it may be due to an issue in how dependencies are defined or how the provisioner is configured.
3. **State File Inconsistencies**:
    - If the Terraform state is not properly updated, Terraform might assume the provisioner has already executed successfully.

---

## How to Ensure the Directory is Copied:

1. **Force the Provisioner to Run**:
    - You can explicitly force the resource to be recreated by tainting it manually:
        
        ```bash
        terraform taint aws_instance.example
        terraform apply
        ```
        
    - This ensures the `file` provisioner runs as part of the resource recreation.
2. **Check Connection Details**:
    - Ensure that the SSH connection to the EC2 instance is valid and working. Incorrect SSH credentials can cause provisioners to fail silently.
3. **Use `depends_on` to Ensure Dependency**:
    - If the provisioner depends on other configurations, explicitly declare dependencies to ensure proper execution:
        
        ```hcl
        provisioner "file" {
          source      = "local_directory/"
          destination = "/remote_directory/"
          connection {
            type     = "ssh"
            user     = "username"
            private_key = file("~/.ssh/id_rsa")
          }
          depends_on = [aws_instance.example]
        }
        ```
        
4. **Debugging Provisioner Logs**:
    - Use Terraform's logging feature to debug provisioner failures. Set the `TF_LOG` environment variable to `DEBUG`:
        
        ```bash
        export TF_LOG=DEBUG
        terraform apply
        ```

## Best Practice: Minimize Provisioner Use

As provisioners are a last-resort solution in Terraform, consider alternative approaches:

- Use **user data scripts** or **cloud-init** to configure the instance during startup.
- Pre-bake required configurations into the AMI used for the EC2 instance.
