# Guide to the `local-exec` Provisioner in Terraform

---

The **`local-exec` provisioner** in Terraform allows you to run commands or scripts **on your local machine** (where Terraform is running) **after a resource is created**. This is useful when you need to trigger actions that aren't directly handled by Terraform.

Here’s a detailed, beginner-friendly explanation.

---

## **What Is a Provisioner?**
A **provisioner** in Terraform is a way to run scripts or commands **as part of deploying resources**. Provisioners are a "last resort" and should only be used when other Terraform features can't handle your needs.

There are two main types:
1. **local-exec**: Runs commands **on your local computer**.
2. **remote-exec**: Runs commands **inside the resource (e.g., a server)**.

## **What Is `local-exec`?**
The `local-exec` provisioner:
- Runs **locally on your computer**.
- Executes a command after Terraform creates a resource (like a server or database).
- Does **not run on the created resource itself**. If you want to run commands on the resource, you would use `remote-exec`.

---

### **Why Use `local-exec`?**
You might use `local-exec` for tasks like:
1. **Recording Information**: Save the private IP of a server to a file.
2. **Triggering Other Scripts or Tools**: Start a CI/CD pipeline or notify other systems.
3. **Debugging**: Quickly verify something about the resource after it’s created.

---

### **How Does It Work?**

#### **Simple Example: Saving a Private IP to a File**

Imagine you’re creating an AWS EC2 instance, and after it's created, you want to save its private IP address to a text file.

Here's the Terraform code:

```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  ami           = "ami-12345678"    # Example AMI ID
  instance_type = "t2.micro"

  provisioner "local-exec" {
    command = "echo ${self.private_ip} >> private_ips.txt"
  }
}
```

**How This Works:**
1. Terraform creates the EC2 instance.
2. After creation, Terraform runs the command:  
   ```bash
   echo [private IP of instance] >> private_ips.txt
   ```
3. The private IP address of the instance gets written to a file called `private_ips.txt`.

---

## **Key Components of `local-exec`**

### 1. **Command**
The `command` is the main argument. It tells Terraform what to execute.

- Example:
  ```hcl
  command = "echo 'Hello, Terraform!' > hello.txt"
  ```
  This command creates a file `hello.txt` with the text "Hello, Terraform!".

### 2. **Working Directory (`working_dir`)**
You can specify a directory where the command should run.

- Example:
  ```hcl
  provisioner "local-exec" {
    command     = "ls > file_list.txt"
    working_dir = "/home/user/documents"
  }
  ```
  This lists all files in `/home/user/documents` and writes the output to `file_list.txt`.

### 3. **Environment Variables (`environment`)**
You can pass key-value pairs to the command as environment variables.

- Example:
  ```hcl
  provisioner "local-exec" {
    command = "echo $GREETING > message.txt"
    environment = {
      GREETING = "Hello, World!"
    }
  }
  ```
  This creates a file `message.txt` containing "Hello, World!".

### 4. **Interpreter**
Use this when the command requires a specific interpreter (like Python or PowerShell).

- Example (Perl):
  ```hcl
  provisioner "local-exec" {
    command     = "print 'Hello, Perl!'"
    interpreter = ["perl", "-e"]
  }
  ```
  This uses Perl to execute the given command.

### 5. **Execution Timing (`when`)**
You can control when the provisioner runs:
- **Default**: After the resource is created.
- **On Destroy**: Run when Terraform destroys the resource.

- Example:
  ```hcl
  provisioner "local-exec" {
    command = "echo 'Instance is being destroyed!' >> log.txt"
    when    = "destroy"
  }
  ```

## **Complete Example**

Let’s combine multiple components into a single example:

```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  ami           = "ami-12345678"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"

  # Provisioner to save instance info and notify
  provisioner "local-exec" {
    command     = "echo Instance ${self.id} is created with IP ${self.private_ip} > instance_info.txt"
    working_dir = "/home/user/terraform"
    environment = {
      NOTIFY_EMAIL = "admin@example.com"
    }
  }
}
```

- **What happens?**
  1. Terraform creates the EC2 instance.
  2. A file `instance_info.txt` is created in `/home/user/terraform` with the instance ID and private IP.
  3. The `NOTIFY_EMAIL` environment variable is available in the command (but unused here).

## **Important Things to Know**

1. **Resource Availability**
   - Even though Terraform creates the resource before running `local-exec`, the resource might not be ready for use (e.g., SSH services might not have started yet).

2. **Command Errors**
   - If the command fails, Terraform marks the entire resource creation as failed. Make sure your commands are reliable.

3. **Security Risks**
   - Avoid directly embedding sensitive information or variables in the `command`. Use `environment` instead.

4. **Alternatives**
   - Only use `local-exec` if necessary. Alternatives like modules, output variables, or data sources are often better.

---

## **Why Should You Be Careful?**

- **Debugging**: Provisioners can be hard to debug if they fail.
- **Complexity**: Commands executed by `local-exec` might depend on external systems or paths, making deployments less predictable.
- **Terraform Philosophy**: Terraform prefers **declarative infrastructure**, where you describe the desired state. Provisioners are an **imperative addition** that breaks this principle.

---

## **Tips for Beginners**
1. **Start Simple**: Use basic commands like `echo` to understand how it works.
2. **Test Commands Locally**: Run your command manually in a terminal first.
3. **Use Logging**: Save outputs to files for debugging.
4. **Keep It Optional**: Avoid overusing provisioners. Use them only when absolutely necessary.

With practice, you’ll know when and how to use `local-exec` effectively!
